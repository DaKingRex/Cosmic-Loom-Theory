## Full Multi-Dimensional Biophotonic Platform

---

## 1. Purpose

LoomSense v3 is the complete, research-grade photonic biosensing platform designed to capture the full multi-dimensional structure of ultraweak biological optical emissions. It integrates:

- spectral
- temporal
- spatial
- coherence
- photon-counting
- and frequency-domain dynamics

into a single unified architecture.

**This version represents the full NuTech vision and serves as the foundation for scientific breakthroughs, clinical tools, and future proprietary consciousness-oriented technologies.**
