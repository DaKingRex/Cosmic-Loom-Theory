Theoretical Background
======================

This section provides an overview of Cosmic Loom Theory's theoretical foundations.

For the complete theoretical documents, see the source files in ``docs/theory/``.

Core Framework: CLT v1.1
------------------------

Cosmic Loom Theory v1.1 focuses on human biological consciousness, treating it not as
a localized neural phenomenon but as a system-level property arising from integrated
field dynamics.

The Loomfield
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Loomfield (L)** is an effective field description capturing coherence-relevant
structure in biological systems. It is not a new fundamental force, but an emergent
description of how multiple biological substrates coordinate.

The Loomfield evolves according to:

.. math::

   \nabla^2 L - \frac{1}{v_L^2} \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial t^2} = \kappa_L \cdot \rho_{coh}

Where:

- :math:`v_L` = Loomfield propagation speed
- :math:`\kappa_L` = Coupling constant
- :math:`\rho_{coh}` = Coherence density (source term)

Energy Resistance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Energy Resistance (éR)** principle defines where coherent dynamics can exist:

.. math::

   \acute{e}R = \frac{EP}{f^2}

Three regimes:

1. **Chaos Regime** (low éR): High frequency relative to energy creates decoherence
2. **Viable Window** (moderate éR): Optimal for coherent biological organization
3. **Rigidity Regime** (high éR): Too much energy relative to dynamics creates frozen states

Consciousness Observable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **consciousness observable (C_bio)** quantifies the "amount" of consciousness:

.. math::

   C_{bio} = Q^n \times \int |\rho_{coh}| \cdot \left|\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}\right| dV

Where:

- **Q** = Coherence metric (spatial organization)
- **n** = 2 for 2D, 3 for 3D (stronger penalty in higher dimensions)
- The integral measures coupled activity

Consciousness requires both coherence (Q) AND activity. Pure coherence without
dynamics (frozen) or pure activity without coherence (chaos) both yield low C_bio.

Biological Substrates
---------------------

CLT identifies four complementary mechanisms supporting Loomfield integration:

1. **Bioelectric Fields** - Morphogenetic gradients (Levin lab research)
2. **Biophotons** - Ultra-weak photon emission (Murugan lab research)
3. **Cytoskeletal Structure** - Microtubule dynamics (Penrose-Hameroff extended)
4. **Genetic Constraints** - DNA as coherence boundary conditions

Related Theoretical Documents

The ``docs/theory/`` folder contains:

- **CLT v1.1** - Core framework for human biological consciousness
- **CLT v2.0** - Planetary-scale extensions
- **Introducing CLT** - Overview and motivation
- **Machines & AI** - Artificial system coherence analysis

Connections to Other Theories
-----------------------------

CLT synthesizes insights from:

- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** - Φ as a coherence measure
- **Global Workspace Theory** - Broadcasting as field propagation
- **Predictive Processing** - Prediction errors as coherence perturbations
- **Quantum Biology** - Coherence at biological scales

Unlike purely philosophical or quantum-mystical approaches, CLT maintains
compatibility with established physics while proposing testable mechanisms.
