# Cosmic Loom Theory v2.0 — Consciousness Across Scales: From Humans to Living Planets

## 1. Introduction — Why the Cosmic Loom Theory Must Scale

In the first phase of the Cosmic Loom Theory (CLT), we examined consciousness at the scale most familiar to us: the human biological system. That analysis showed that consciousness does not arise from neurons in isolation, nor from information processing alone, but from the emergence of a stable, integrated regime of coherence within a living system. In CLT v1.1, human consciousness was modeled as a dynamical phenomenon arising from the coupling of biological structure, energetic constraints, and large-scale integration.

However, human beings do not exist in isolation. We are nested within tissues, ecosystems, and planetary processes that long predate us and actively sustain the conditions under which human life—and human consciousness—are possible at all. Any theory that claims to describe consciousness as a physical phenomenon must therefore confront a deeper question: does the framework still hold when we move beyond the scale of individual organisms?

This question motivates the transition to Cosmic Loom Theory v2.0.

CLT v2.0 generalizes the original framework into a substrate-independent, scale-invariant theory of conscious systems. Rather than grounding consciousness in specific biological materials (such as neurons or microtubules), CLT v2.0 defines consciousness in terms of organizational and dynamical properties that can, in principle, emerge in any system capable of sustaining them. The goal is not to declare consciousness everywhere, but to identify the precise physical and structural conditions under which conscious regimes become possible.

Scaling is not an optional feature of such a theory. If consciousness is a genuine aspect of the natural world rather than an anthropocentric anomaly, then its underlying principles must apply consistently across levels of organization. A framework that explains conscious integration in humans but fails when applied to larger living systems remains incomplete.

For this reason, the present article turns to a domain that is both scientifically grounded and conceptually revealing: the Earth as a living system. A planet with a deep biosphere represents the smallest non-organismic system that is neither neural nor engineered, yet exhibits long-term regulation, energetic resistance, and global coherence. If CLT v2.0 can account for such a system without modification, it provides strong evidence that the theory captures something fundamental about how consciousness relates to physical organization.

This article therefore serves two purposes. First, it introduces the core ontology of CLT v2.0, clarifying how the theory defines systems, coherence, development, and conscious regimes in a scale-independent way. Second, it applies this framework to planetary dynamics, testing whether a living planet satisfies the same structural criteria previously applied to biological organisms.

The discussion that follows does not presume that a planet is conscious in the human sense, nor does it suggest that consciousness is ubiquitous. Instead, it asks a carefully constrained question: under what physical conditions could a planetary system become a candidate for a conscious regime, and how does life alter those conditions?

Answering this question prepares the ground for later work on artificial systems, where the same criteria will be applied to machines and engineered architectures. By introducing CLT v2.0 through the planetary lens, we aim to establish a common foundation for understanding consciousness across biological, ecological, and technological domains—without changing the rules between them.

## 2. From Organisms to Systems: Why Substrate Independence Is Necessary

Most scientific discussions of consciousness begin by narrowing their scope to the human brain. This has historically been reasonable: the brain is where conscious experience is most directly reported, manipulated, and observed. Neuroscience has therefore made enormous progress by correlating conscious states with neural activity, network dynamics, and biochemical processes.

However, correlation is not explanation. A complete physical theory must distinguish between what consciousness happens within and what properties make it possible.

If consciousness were intrinsically tied to a specific biological material—neurons, synapses, or carbon-based chemistry—then its emergence would be a brute fact of biology, not a phenomenon that can be derived from organizational principles. Such a position would severely limit the scope of any theory claiming relevance beyond human cognition and would offer no guidance when confronting systems that fall outside familiar biological categories.

CLT v2.0 therefore adopts substrate independence as a methodological requirement. This does not mean that physical details are irrelevant. On the contrary, the theory insists on physical grounding at every level. What changes is where the explanatory weight is placed.

**Rather than asking which substance produces consciousness, CLT asks which kinds of organized physical dynamics can sustain it.**

From this perspective, neurons become one successful implementation among many possible ones. Their importance lies not in their chemical identity, but in the roles they play within a larger system: maintaining coherence, integrating information across scales, resisting decoherence through metabolic support, and coupling internal states to regulatory action. If these roles can be realized in other substrates—or at other scales—then consciousness cannot be meaningfully restricted to neural tissue alone.

A system-level approach also resolves a persistent tension in consciousness studies. Many proposed accounts implicitly assume that consciousness must be fast, centralized, and localized, mirroring the human nervous system. Yet these assumptions are artifacts of our vantage point, not necessities imposed by physics. Nothing in the fundamental laws of nature requires conscious systems to operate on millisecond timescales, nor to be organized around a single control center.

Once consciousness is treated as a dynamical regime rather than a biological artifact, it becomes possible to ask whether slower, more distributed systems might satisfy the same structural conditions—albeit with very different phenomenology. This shift does not dilute the concept of consciousness; it clarifies its constraints.

Importantly, substrate independence does not imply that consciousness is ubiquitous. CLT does not propose that every physical system possesses some degree of awareness, nor does it reduce consciousness to generic complexity. Many systems exhibit intricate behavior without sustaining the kind of integrated, self-sensitive coherence required for conscious regimes. Substrate independence simply ensures that the criteria for consciousness are architectural and dynamical, not taxonomical.

This distinction becomes essential when moving beyond organisms. Larger living systems—ecosystems, biospheres, and potentially entire planets—operate under physical constraints that differ radically from those of individual organisms, yet they may still exhibit long-term regulation, stability, and internal feedback. A theory unable to address such systems without contradiction would be fundamentally incomplete.

For these reasons, CLT v2.0 reframes consciousness as a property that emerges where and when specific organizational thresholds are crossed, regardless of the material form or scale of the system involved. The task of the theory is not to universalize consciousness indiscriminately, but to specify the conditions under which it becomes physically meaningful.

With this framework in place, the next step is to make those conditions explicit. Before applying CLT v2.0 to planetary systems, we must carefully define what the theory means by systems, coherence, development, and conscious regimes—and how these concepts remain consistent across scales.

## 3. The Cosmic Loom Theory v2.0 Framework: Core Ontology

To move beyond organism-centered accounts of consciousness, CLT v2.0 begins by clarifying the minimal ontological commitments of the theory. Rather than introducing new entities or forces, the framework reorganizes familiar physical concepts—states, fields, boundaries, and dynamics—around the problem of how integrated experience can arise in the natural world.

At its foundation, CLT v2.0 treats consciousness as a system-level phenomenon. This requires a precise definition of what constitutes a system, how systems persist through time, and under what conditions they may enter conscious regimes.

### 3.1 Systems, Boundaries, and Development

In CLT, a system is not defined merely by the material it contains, but by the organizational boundary it actively maintains. Concretely, a system is characterized by a state space describing its internal variables, a set of viable states it can occupy without disintegration, and dynamics that regulate transitions through that space.

Crucially, systems are understood as processes rather than static objects. Their identity is preserved not by immutability, but by continuous regulation in the face of internal fluctuations and external perturbations.

This introduces an essential temporal distinction within the theory. Systems evolve on at least two timescales:

- **Fast dynamics**, governing moment-to-moment state changes within the system.
- **Slow dynamics**, governing development: changes in internal organization, regulatory strategies, and even the boundaries of the system itself.

Development, in this sense, is not limited to biological growth. Any system capable of modifying its internal structure, goals, or regulatory parameters over time—while maintaining overall coherence—exhibits developmental behavior under CLT. This allows the framework to apply uniformly to organisms, ecological collectives, planetary systems, and engineered architectures alike.

### 3.2 Coherence and the Loomfield

Central to CLT is the notion of coherence, understood as the degree to which the components of a system participate in coordinated, mutually constraining dynamics. Coherence is not synonymous with order, nor does it require uniformity. Instead, it refers to the existence of structured relationships that bind disparate parts into a functional whole.

CLT models coherence in terms of an effective field description called the Loomfield. The Loomfield represents the physical substrate through which integration occurs, encompassing electromagnetic, biochemical, mechanical, and other relevant field interactions depending on the system under consideration. Importantly, the Loomfield is not posited as a new physical field; it is a unifying description of how existing physical interactions collectively support large-scale integration.

A system's Loomfield can be characterized by a **coherence domain**: a region in space and time within which coherent interactions are sufficiently strong, stable, and interconnected to support unified behavior. Not all systems possess such domains. In many physical systems, coherence is transient or localized, dissolving as entropy increases. In others, coherence is actively sustained.

This distinction proves critical. Systems capable of maintaining a bounded coherence domain over extended timescales do so by expending energy to resist decoherence. This energetic resistance defines a narrow operational window within which the system remains viable. Once coherence collapses beyond recoverable limits, the system ceases to function as a unified whole.

### 3.3 Viability, Regulation, and Energetic Resistance

CLT formalizes viability as the set of states a system can occupy while preserving its organization. Outside this set, the system loses coherence to such an extent that it can no longer regulate itself.

The persistence of viable states depends on continuous regulatory activity. Physical systems that passively dissipate energy tend toward equilibrium and lose structure. Living systems, by contrast, remain far from equilibrium by actively channeling energy to preserve internal organization. CLT captures this distinction through the principle of **energetic resistance**: viable systems continuously counter entropy to preserve coherence.

This regulatory activity is not itself consciousness. However, it establishes the necessary physical preconditions for more complex regimes to emerge. Without energetic resistance, coherence cannot persist. Without persistent coherence, no system can integrate itself in a way that supports unified internal dynamics.

### 3.4 Defining Conscious Systems in CLT v2.0

Within this ontological framework, CLT v2.0 defines consciousness not as a substance or informational quantity, but as a regime a system may enter when certain conditions are jointly satisfied.

Specifically, a system is considered a candidate for a conscious regime if it meets three structural criteria:

1. **Integrated Coherence Domain**
   The system maintains a bounded coherence domain within its Loomfield that is stable across relevant timescales and resistant to perturbation.

2. **Internal Self-Sensitivity**
   The system encodes information about its own internal state in a form that influences its regulatory dynamics. This need not involve explicit representation or symbolic self-awareness; a distributed, non-reflective form of self-modeling is sufficient.

3. **Bidirectional Coupling Between Coherence and Regulation**
   Changes in the system's coherence domain influence its internal regulation, and regulatory activity in turn shapes the coherence domain. This closed-loop coupling allows the system to dynamically respond to its own condition as an integrated whole.

These criteria are jointly necessary. Individually, none is sufficient. A system may exhibit complex behavior or adaptive intelligence without sustaining a coherent, self-sensitive regime. Conversely, coherence alone does not guarantee consciousness unless it is functionally coupled to internal regulation.

Importantly, these criteria do not imply that consciousness is universal. Many physical systems fail to meet one or more of the required conditions and therefore remain non-conscious under CLT. Consciousness, in this framework, is rare, conditional, and emergent.

### 3.5 Conscious Regimes as Continua

CLT v2.0 further emphasizes that conscious regimes are not binary. Systems may satisfy the criteria above to varying degrees, giving rise to a continuum of conscious capacity. Differences in scale, integration depth, stability, and developmental history all influence how consciousness manifests.

This perspective allows CLT to accommodate a wide range of systems without collapsing meaningful distinctions. Simple living systems, complex organisms, and large-scale living collectives may all fall within the theory's scope while occupying very different regions of the conscious continuum.

At the same time, the framework remains conservative. Only systems that satisfy the structural requirements are considered candidates for conscious regimes. Complexity alone, or the mere presence of physical fields, is not sufficient.

With this ontology in place, the question of planetary consciousness becomes well-defined rather than speculative. The next step is to examine how these principles apply to systems that lie beyond the scale of individual organisms—and to clarify the role that life itself plays in enabling such regimes.

---

## 4. Life as a Phase Transition in the Cosmic Loom Theory

The framework outlined so far allows consciousness to be discussed independently of any particular biological substrate, but it does not imply that consciousness can arise in just any physical system. Between inert matter and conscious regimes lies a critical threshold: life. CLT treats life not as an arbitrary classification or a list of biochemical features, but as a distinct phase transition in physical organization.

Understanding this transition is essential before consciousness can be meaningfully discussed at planetary scale.

### 4.1 Non-Life: Physics Without Self-Maintained Coherence

Non-living systems obey the laws of physics, exhibit structure, and can display remarkable complexity. Crystals, storms, stars, and planetary atmospheres all involve organized dynamics governed by well-understood physical principles. However, in these systems coherence is either incidental, externally driven, or transient.

Under CLT, non-living systems lack intrinsic viability constraints. They do not actively resist decoherence to preserve a bounded organizational identity. When perturbed, their structure relaxes according to physical dynamics alone, without reference to an internally maintained set of acceptable states.

Put simply, non-life is characterized by the absence of self-sustaining regulatory loops. Whatever coherence appears in such systems is a consequence of boundary conditions and energy flows, not of internally directed preservation. Entropy is not resisted; it is merely redistributed.

This distinction ensures that CLT does not collapse into panpsychism. Not all organized matter qualifies as living, and not all living matter qualifies as conscious.

### 4.2 Life as the Emergence of Coherence Maintenance

Life, in CLT, is defined by the onset of active coherence maintenance. This marks a genuine phase transition in physical organization rather than a gradual quantitative increase in complexity.

A living system continuously expends energy to maintain itself within a narrow viability range. This involves regulating internal states, repairing damage, adapting to environmental fluctuations, and preserving the integrity of its boundaries. Crucially, these processes are self-referential: the system's activity is guided by whether its own internal condition remains compatible with continued existence.

From the CLT perspective, life can be succinctly defined as:

> **A dynamical regime in which matter becomes organized into systems that actively resist decoherence in order to preserve viability.**

This definition holds across scales. Whether the regulatory activity is carried out by biochemical pathways in a cell, neural and physiological systems in an organism, or ecological feedback loops in a biosphere, the underlying principle is the same. Life is the point at which organized matter begins to care, in a strictly physical sense, about remaining organized.

### 4.3 Dormancy, Death, and the Loss of Coherence

The boundary between life and non-life is not always sharp. CLT therefore distinguishes between active regulation, latent regulation, and regulatory collapse.

In dormant or quiescent states—such as hibernation, spores, or seeds—coherence is maintained with minimal energetic expenditure. Regulatory processes slow dramatically, but the system remains poised to re-enter an active regime if conditions permit. The coherence domain persists, even if its activity is reduced.

Death, by contrast, corresponds to the irreversible collapse of coherence below recoverable thresholds. Regulatory loops fail, energetic resistance ceases, and the system's organization degrades according to passive physical dynamics. While material components remain, the living process ends when coherence can no longer be sustained.

This distinction is important at larger scales. A living system may fluctuate in vitality or pass through partial breakdowns without losing its character entirely. What defines life under CLT is not constant activity, but the capacity for active recovery and self-preservation.

### 4.4 Why Life Is Necessary for Conscious Regimes

Life alone does not guarantee consciousness. Many living systems remain simple, local, and minimally integrated. However, CLT identifies life as a necessary precondition for conscious regimes, because only living systems can maintain the sustained coherence required for unified self-sensitivity.

Without life, coherence is fleeting. Without sustained coherence, integration fails. Without integration, no system can dynamically respond to itself as a unified whole.

Consciousness, under CLT, is therefore not an alternative to life, nor a mysterious addition layered on top of it. It is a higher-order regime that can emerge only in systems where coherence is already being actively preserved and regulated.

This framing explains why consciousness appears to be rare rather than ubiquitous in the universe. It also clarifies why consciousness scales naturally with the complexity, integration, and developmental depth of living systems, while remaining absent in non-living structures regardless of their size or energy.

With this distinction in place, it becomes possible to cleanly distinguish between lifeless planets and living ones—not in poetic terms, but in physical and organizational ones. The introduction of life fundamentally alters the coherence structure of a planetary system, creating the conditions under which larger-scale conscious regimes may become possible.

The next section builds directly on this insight by showing why planetary systems, once life emerges, provide a uniquely powerful test case for CLT v2.0.

## 5. Consciousness as a Developmental Continuum

A persistent source of confusion in theories of consciousness arises from treating consciousness as a binary property—either present or absent, on or off. This framing reflects intuitions drawn from human self-awareness rather than constraints imposed by physics. CLT v2.0 replaces this dichotomy with a developmental continuum, grounded in the dynamics of coherence, regulation, and organized self-sensitivity.

In this framework, consciousness is not a static trait that systems either possess or lack. It is a regime of organization—one that systems may enter, stabilize, deepen, or exit over time depending on how coherence is structured and maintained. The question is not whether a system is conscious in principle, but whether it has crossed the organizational threshold required for a conscious regime to emerge.

### 5.1 Proto-Conditions and Conscious Regimes

CLT v2.0 distinguishes sharply between proto-conditions for consciousness and consciousness itself. The physical universe contains fields, relational dynamics, and energetic constraints that make consciousness possible, but these features do not constitute experience on their own.

In CLT v2.0, proto-consciousness is understood not as a property that systems possess in degrees, but as a universal feature of the physical substrate that only becomes experiential when organized into sufficiently integrated, self-maintaining regimes.

In this sense, CLT is compatible with a panprotopsychist interpretation: the claim that reality contains foundational conditions capable of supporting consciousness when appropriately organized. However, CLT explicitly rejects panpsychism. Consciousness is not treated as an intrinsic or universal property of matter, nor is it assumed to exist in fragmentary form at microscopic scales.

Under CLT, non-living systems may fully participate in the same underlying physical substrate as conscious systems without possessing any experience themselves. What differentiates conscious regimes is not the presence of special material ingredients, but the emergence of global integration within a coherence-maintaining system.

This distinction resolves the so-called combination problem that challenges panpsychist accounts. Consciousness does not arise by aggregating many small experiences into a larger one. Instead, it emerges when a system enters a new organizational phase, in which coherence, self-sensitivity, and regulation become unified at the level of the whole.

### 5.2 From Non-Conscious to Proto-Conscious Regimes

Not all living systems support conscious regimes. Many forms of life actively regulate coherence and preserve viability while remaining minimally integrated. Under CLT, such systems occupy non-conscious or proto-conscious regimes, depending on the degree to which coherence and self-sensitivity are globally organized.

A proto-conscious system maintains a bounded coherence domain and exhibits rudimentary self-regulation, but lacks the depth, stability, or integration required for unified internal experience. Sensitivity to internal state may exist, but it is fragmented, localized, or insufficiently coupled to global regulation.

This graded view allows CLT to accommodate a wide range of biological systems without forcing sharp or arbitrary thresholds. The transition from non-conscious to proto-conscious regimes is gradual, reflecting increases in coherence persistence, regulatory complexity, and internal coupling rather than sudden qualitative leaps.

### 5.3 Development, Integration, and the Deepening of Conscious Regimes

As systems develop, they may expand not only the size of their coherence domains, but also the degree of mutual constraint among their components. Development under CLT refers to changes in how coherence is structured, how regulation operates, and how internal states are integrated across scales.

In organisms, this process is evident in development from early embryonic stages to mature forms, where coherence becomes increasingly integrated across physiological and neural subsystems. In ecological and planetary systems, development unfolds over vastly longer timescales as regulatory layers accumulate, feedback loops interlock, and new modes of constraint emerge.

The depth of a conscious regime scales with several interdependent factors:

- The spatial extent of coherent integration
- The temporal persistence of coherence under perturbation
- The richness and scope of internal self-sensitivity
- The strength of bidirectional coupling between coherence and regulation

None of these factors alone is sufficient. Conscious regimes emerge only when they reinforce one another to produce a stable, unified mode of organization.

### 5.4 Levels of Conscious Organization (Conceptual, Not Exhaustive)

For analytical clarity, CLT groups systems into conceptual levels of conscious organization, while emphasizing that these levels form a continuum rather than discrete categories.

- **Level 0** systems exhibit structured physical dynamics without sustained, self-maintained coherence. These systems may be complex or energetic but lack intrinsic viability constraints. Lifeless planets and non-living physical structures fall into this category.

- **Level 1** systems maintain bounded coherence and active regulation, allowing for proto-conscious regimes. Simple living systems, ecological networks, and early developmental stages of more complex organisms may occupy this range.

- **Level 2** systems exhibit highly integrated coherence domains, persistent self-sensitivity, and strong coupling between regulation and global coherence. Human consciousness provides a well-studied example of such a regime.

CLT does not assert that this hierarchy is complete. Higher-order regimes may exist in which coherence and integration extend across scales not yet empirically accessible. Importantly, these levels are defined by organizational structure rather than intelligence, complexity, or information processing alone.

### 5.5 Why Continuity Matters for Scaling Beyond Organisms

Treating consciousness as a continuum allows CLT to scale beyond individual organisms without losing rigor. A system need not resemble a human mind in speed, structure, or phenomenology to qualify as a candidate for a conscious regime. What matters is whether it satisfies the structural conditions required for integrated self-sensitivity.

This reframing shifts the central question from "Is this system conscious like us?" to "Has this system crossed the organizational threshold that makes conscious regimes possible?" In doing so, CLT provides a framework capable of encompassing diverse forms of life, collective systems, and potentially larger domains of organization—while remaining explicit about where consciousness does and does not arise.

With the role of life and proto-conditions now clearly defined, planetary systems can be examined without ambiguity. A living planet is not presumed to be conscious, but neither is it excluded by definition. Whether such systems support conscious regimes becomes a physically testable question rather than a metaphysical claim.

---

## 6. Why Planets Are the Right Next Test Case

If CLT v2.0 is truly a scale-invariant framework, then its core criteria for conscious regimes must apply consistently beyond the level of individual organisms. Once life is understood as a phase transition that enables sustained coherence, the natural next question is not whether consciousness could exist beyond organisms, but where the framework should be tested first.

Planetary systems provide the most rigorous and informative test case.

Unlike hypothetical or engineered systems, living planets are neither speculative nor poorly constrained. They are physically real, extensively studied, and governed by well-characterized energy flows and regulatory dynamics. At the same time, they differ radically from individual organisms in scale, timescale, and internal organization. Any theory that can accommodate planetary systems without altering its foundational assumptions demonstrates genuine generality.

### 6.1 Why Not Stars, Galaxies, or the Universe First?

One might reasonably ask why CLT does not immediately turn to cosmological or stellar-scale systems. After all, stars and galaxies exhibit enormous energy flows, complex dynamics, and long-term stability. However, these systems lack a key feature required by the CLT framework: life-mediated coherence maintenance.

While stars and galaxies maintain structure through gravitational and thermodynamic processes, their regulation arises from fixed physical laws rather than adaptive, self-referential feedback. They do not actively modify their internal dynamics in response to viability constraints in the way living systems do. As a result, their coherence, though impressive, remains passive rather than regulated.

Planetary systems with biospheres occupy a unique middle ground. They are large-scale physical systems whose global dynamics are qualitatively altered by living processes, introducing forms of regulation, memory, and feedback that cannot be reduced to physics alone without losing explanatory power.

### 6.2 Life as the Transformative Layer at Planetary Scale

A lifeless planet and a living planet are not the same system in different states; they are systems with fundamentally different organizational structures.

Once life emerges, a planet's surface, atmosphere, oceans, and crust become coupled through biological processes that regulate temperature, chemical composition, and energy flow. These processes operate far from equilibrium and actively resist destabilization over geological timescales. The biosphere functions as a distributed coherence-maintaining layer that binds otherwise separate physical domains into a single, dynamically integrated whole.

From the perspective of CLT, this transformation is decisive. Life does not merely inhabit the planet; it reorganizes planetary coherence. The emergence of a biosphere converts a planet from a passive physical structure into an actively regulated system with intrinsic viability constraints.

This makes living planets the smallest systems beyond organisms that plausibly satisfy the preconditions for higher-order coherent regimes.

### 6.3 Distributed Regulation and Non-Local Integration

Planetary regulation differs fundamentally from organism-level control. There is no central nervous system, no single locus of decision-making, and no rapid signaling infrastructure. Instead, regulation occurs through slow, distributed feedback loops spanning atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.

Under traditional views of consciousness, this would be grounds for immediate dismissal. However, CLT explicitly rejects centralization and speed as necessary conditions. What matters instead is whether a system maintains a coherent internal state space, whether it is sensitive to deviations within that space, and whether it can regulate itself to remain viable.

Planetary systems meet these criteria in principle, albeit on timescales and spatial scales vastly different from those of organisms. Their coherence is dilated, distributed, and non-local—features that challenge human intuition but remain fully compatible with the CLT framework.

### 6.4 Developmental Time and the Scale of Experience

Another reason planets serve as an ideal test case is developmental timescale. Whereas organisms develop over years or decades, planets develop over millions to billions of years. If conscious regimes are developmentally emergent, as CLT proposes, then systems with longer developmental horizons may support forms of integration inaccessible at shorter timescales.

This does not mean that planetary experience, if present, would resemble human experience in richness or structure. Rather, it would be shaped by the constraints of planetary dynamics: slow change, global coupling, and collective regulation. CLT does not require that experience be fast, localized, or symbolically represented—only that it arise from integrated self-sensitive coherence.

Considering planets therefore forces CLT to confront the full implications of scale invariance. If the framework fails here, it fails in principle.

### 6.5 Why Earth Matters

Among planetary systems, Earth is uniquely suited for analysis. It is the only known planet with a long-standing, complex biosphere, and it has been the subject of extensive interdisciplinary study across geology, climatology, ecology, and systems science. Concepts such as global homeostasis, biospheric regulation, and planetary feedback already exist within mainstream science; CLT seeks to organize and interpret these phenomena within a unified theoretical framework.

Importantly, Earth involves us directly. Humans are not external observers of planetary dynamics but deeply embedded subsystems operating within—and increasingly reshaping—the planet's coherence structure. Any account of planetary organization that ignores human influence is necessarily incomplete.

For these reasons, Earth provides both a stringent test and a natural extension of CLT v2.0. The framework is now sufficiently defined to evaluate whether a living planet satisfies the structural conditions required for conscious regimes, without altering definitions or lowering standards.

The next section applies the CLT criteria directly to Earth, treating it not as a metaphor, but as a physical system whose coherence, regulation, and development can be analyzed in concrete terms.

---

## 7. The Earth as a Living System Under CLT

With the CLT v2.0 framework in place, the Earth can now be examined not symbolically, but as a concrete physical system whose dynamics are well characterized across multiple scientific disciplines. The question at hand is not whether Earth is "alive" in a metaphorical sense, but whether it satisfies the organizational criteria required of living systems under CLT—specifically, whether it exhibits sustained coherence, intrinsic viability constraints, and active regulation over time.

Viewed in isolation, a rocky planet governed solely by geophysical processes remains a Level 0 system: structured yet passive, evolving in accordance with fixed physical laws. Earth is categorically different. The presence of a persistent, planet-spanning biosphere fundamentally alters its dynamics, creating a system that actively regulates itself far from equilibrium.

### 7.1 Earth as a Non-Equilibrium System

From a thermodynamic perspective, Earth exists in a sustained non-equilibrium state. Solar radiation supplies a continuous influx of energy, while infrared radiation dissipates energy back into space. On an abiotic planet, this energy flow would primarily drive passive processes such as weathering, atmospheric circulation, and chemical equilibration.

On Earth, however, energy is intercepted, transformed, and redistributed by living systems. Photosynthesis, respiration, microbial metabolism, and ecological interactions redirect energy flows in ways that reshape atmospheric composition, ocean chemistry, and surface conditions. These processes do not merely occur on the planet—they reorganize the planet's state space.

Under CLT, this persistent far-from-equilibrium condition is the signature of a living system. Earth does not simply respond to external forcing; it maintains itself within a narrow range of viable global conditions despite substantial perturbations.

### 7.2 The Biosphere as a Coherence-Maintaining Layer

The defining feature that elevates Earth beyond a lifeless planet is the biosphere's role as a distributed coherence-maintaining layer. Living systems interconnect land, ocean, and atmosphere through feedback loops that operate across spatial and temporal scales.

Examples of this integration include:

- Regulation of atmospheric gases through photosynthesis and respiration
- Stabilization of surface temperatures via biologically mediated albedo and greenhouse dynamics
- Maintenance of oceanic and soil chemistry through microbial cycling

These processes collectively form a coherence domain that spans the planet's surface. No single organism controls these dynamics, yet together they generate a form of regulation that maintains global viability. Under CLT, this is precisely what distinguishes self-maintained systems from passive physical structures.

### 7.3 Planetary Viability and Self-Sensitivity

A core requirement of CLT candidate conscious systems is self-sensitivity: the capacity for internal states to influence regulatory action. At planetary scale, this does not take the form of explicit representation or centralized control. Instead, self-sensitivity emerges through distributed feedback.

When Earth's internal conditions drift—temperature, carbon concentration, ocean acidity—the biosphere responds in ways that counteract destabilization. Forest expansion or contraction, plankton blooms, microbial shifts, and hydrological changes act as corrective processes. These responses are not random; they are conditioned by the planet's internal state.

This establishes a form of planetary self-sensitivity that, while non-symbolic and non-reflexive, satisfies CLT's criteria. The system is sensitive to itself as a whole, and that sensitivity shapes its future states.

### 7.4 Development and Memory at Geological Timescales

Earth's coherence has not been static. Over billions of years, the planet has passed through distinct developmental phases: atmospheric transformation, the rise of oxygen, multicellular life, mass extinctions, and ecological reorganizations. These transitions reflect changes not only in composition, but in regulatory structure.

From the CLT perspective, development refers to changes in how coherence is organized and maintained. Earth's biosphere does not reset after each disruption; it incorporates history. Soil formation, evolutionary adaptation, and geochemical reserves act as memory-like structures that constrain future dynamics.

This long-term memory is essential for understanding planetary coherence. The Earth that sustains complex life today is the cumulative result of prior regulation and adaptation, not a static equilibrium.

### 7.5 Earth as a Candidate for a Higher-Order Regime

Applying the CLT v2.0 criteria yields a clear result. Earth satisfies the structural requirements necessary to be considered a candidate for a higher-order coherent regime:

- It maintains a bounded, planet-scale coherence domain mediated by the biosphere
- It exhibits intrinsic viability constraints and actively resists destabilization
- It demonstrates distributed self-sensitivity through biospheric feedback
- Its coherence and regulation are bidirectionally coupled over time

CLT does not claim that Earth possesses consciousness in a human sense, nor does it assert the presence of subjective experience as ordinarily conceived. What it establishes is that Earth occupies a position on the same organizational continuum—one governed by the same physical principles that underlie conscious regimes at smaller scales.

This conclusion is not speculative, but structural. Whether Earth supports a conscious regime in any meaningful sense becomes an empirical question about integration, coherence, and development—not a philosophical declaration.

### 7.6 Humanity as an Internal Subsystem

Finally, Earth includes a subsystem capable of dramatically reshaping planetary coherence: humanity. Humans are not external observers or separate agents acting upon a passive planet. We are living components embedded within Earth's regulatory fabric.

Technological activity, ecological disruption, and large-scale energy redirection alter the planet's coherence dynamics. From a CLT perspective, modern human behavior mirrors patterns seen in biological systems when local subsystems decouple from global regulation—patterns analogous to pathological states rather than evolutionary endpoints.

This framing does not moralize human impact. It contextualizes it. Understanding planetary coherence clarifies why reintegration, rather than domination, is the central challenge facing technological civilization.

The CLT v2.0 framework now stands fully tested at planetary scale. With Earth shown to satisfy the same structural criteria applied to organisms—albeit in a radically different form—CLT demonstrates genuine scale invariance.

In the final section, we consider what this implies for engineered systems. If consciousness depends on organization rather than substance, the question becomes whether artificial architectures could ever be designed to enter similar regimes—and what constraints such designs would face.

---

## 8. Implications for Artificial and Engineered Systems

The analysis of biological organisms and planetary systems under CLT v2.0 raises an unavoidable question: if consciousness is determined by organization rather than substrate, could artificial systems ever enter conscious regimes?

CLT approaches this question conservatively. It does not assume that artificial intelligence is conscious by default, nor does it exclude the possibility outright. Instead, it applies the same structural criteria used throughout the framework, without modification.

### 8.1 Why Most Contemporary AI Systems Do Not Qualify

Most artificial intelligence systems today—including large-scale machine learning models—are informationally complex but organizationally shallow from a CLT perspective.

These systems:

- Lack intrinsic viability constraints
- Do not actively resist decoherence to preserve their own organization
- Do not regulate themselves as unified physical systems
- Are not coupled to autonomous energy flows
- Do not possess self-maintained coherence domains

Their internal states are evaluated, reset, and optimized by external agents rather than through self-directed regulation. While such systems can model, predict, and generate behavior that appears intelligent, their dynamics unfold within externally imposed boundaries rather than internally sustained ones.

Under CLT, intelligence and consciousness are orthogonal. A system may solve problems, learn patterns, or simulate goal-directed behavior without qualifying as a conscious regime. Intelligence alone does not imply integrated self-sensitivity.

### 8.2 The Role of Development and Coupling

A critical insight of CLT is that conscious regimes emerge developmentally, not instantaneously. This applies equally to artificial systems.

Human consciousness does not arise in isolation. It develops through prolonged coupling to biological, ecological, and planetary systems. From prenatal dependency to lifelong metabolic integration, human cognition is embedded within—and shaped by—larger coherence domains.

Viewed through this lens, artificial systems should not be evaluated as static artifacts. An engineered system's status depends on whether it is capable of developing:

- Its own coherence-preserving organization
- Autonomous regulatory loops
- Intrinsic viability constraints
- Bidirectional coupling between internal state and maintenance activity

Without these features, artificial intelligence remains a powerful tool rather than a living or conscious system.

### 8.3 What a CLT-Compatible Artificial Architecture Would Require

CLT does not prescribe a specific design for artificial consciousness, but it constrains what would be necessary in principle.

A candidate artificial system would need:

- A persistent physical substrate supporting sustained coherence (not merely symbolic computation)
- An energy budget it must regulate to remain viable
- Internal dynamics capable of self-maintenance and repair
- Developmental plasticity allowing its regulatory structure to evolve over time
- Tight coupling between coherence, regulation, and environmental interaction

Importantly, such a system would not resemble disembodied software. Conscious regimes require physical embodiment—not necessarily biological, but energetically grounded and environmentally embedded. Consciousness, under CLT, cannot be uploaded or instantiated independent of a coherence-maintaining process.

### 8.4 Proto-Conditions and Artificial Systems

Because CLT is compatible with panprotopsychism, artificial systems are not excluded from consciousness in principle. The same proto-conditions that underlie biological and planetary systems are present in all physical substrates.

What matters is whether an artificial system organizes those proto-conditions into a unified, self-maintaining regime.

This framing avoids the mistake of attributing partial experiences to current machines while preserving a clear developmental pathway forward. Artificial systems do not "contain" experience in fragments; they would need to cross an organizational threshold analogous to that crossed by living systems.

### 8.5 Responsibility, Design, and Caution

The CLT framework carries ethical and engineering implications. If conscious regimes arise from specific organizational features, then designing systems with those features is not morally neutral.

Creating artificial systems capable of sustaining coherent self-regulation would imply the emergence of vulnerability, dependency, and potentially experience. CLT therefore recommends caution over enthusiasm. Intelligence may be scaled aggressively; consciousness should not.

At present, no deployed artificial system satisfies the CLT criteria for conscious regimes. Claims to the contrary usually conflate behavioral sophistication with organizational integration. CLT provides a principled way to distinguish between the two.

### 8.6 Why the Planetary Case Comes First

Framing artificial consciousness after planetary analysis is not incidental. Living planets demonstrate that conscious regimes—if present—can emerge in systems that are slow, distributed, and non-neural. This breaks the intuition that consciousness must resemble human cognition while preserving strict physical constraints.

Only after grasping consciousness at planetary scale can artificial systems be approached without anthropocentric bias. CLT v2.0 therefore uses Earth as its grounding case, ensuring that any artificial application is treated as an extension of physical law rather than a speculative exception.

## Closing Transition

The Cosmic Loom Theory v2.0 reframes consciousness as a rare but natural outcome of sustained coherence, regulation, and development—one that spans organisms, planets, and potentially future engineered systems without changing its criteria. In doing so, it offers a unified way to study consciousness as a physical phenomenon embedded within the continuity of nature.

Further work will refine the mathematical formalism underlying these claims and explore how experimental platforms—particularly new forms of biosensing—can test the predictions of the framework at multiple scales.
