# LoomSense™ — Executive Summary

**NuTech | Founder: Rex Fraterne**

---

## Overview

LoomSense™ is NuTech's next-generation photonic biosensing platform designed to reveal a new data layer in biology: the multi-dimensional structure of ultraweak biophoton emissions.

Living systems produce faint optical signals that correlate with metabolic state, tissue coherence, and physiological transitions. But today's tools—PMTs, EMCCDs, spectrometers—capture only fragments:

- intensity only
- space only
- wavelength only
- no coherence
- no picosecond timing
- no multi-channel structure

LoomSense fills this gap, providing a unified architecture capable of measuring:

- spectral structure (400–1300 nm)
- sub-nanometer resolution
- picosecond temporal correlations
- spatial patterns
- coherence signatures
- ultraweak photon counts approaching the single-photon limit

**This platform unlocks biological information that has never been accessible to science before.**

## The Problem

Despite decades of evidence for ultraweak biological photon emissions, the field remains technologically underdeveloped:

- PMTs lack spatial and spectral resolution
- EMCCDs aren't ideal for quantitative data
- spectrometers lack timing or coherence information
- no existing device integrates optical, temporal, and coherence channels into one system

This leaves vast biological and medical insights unexplored — from neural tissue dynamics to mitochondrial health and early-stage disease detection.

## The LoomSense Solution

LoomSense introduces a phased photonic biosensing platform that expands capability over time while maintaining a unified device architecture.

### Phase I — LoomSense v1

A MHz-focused biosensor enabling the first multi-dimensional measurement of ultraweak biological emissions.

- detects MHz-frequency biosignal signatures linked to microtubule resonance
- integrates biophoton intensity + temporal structure
- uses accessible RF + optical hardware to produce early feasibility data
- establishes foundational biological correlations for R&D and early customers

### Phase II — LoomSense v2

A PIC-based GHz biosensing platform expanding into deeper biological coherence layers.

- adds GHz microwave/photonic sensing
- introduces PIC waveguided spectral separation
- integrates nonlinear mixing to infer hidden high-frequency biological dynamics
- bridges MHz signals to multi-channel optical readouts
- ideal for neuroscience, tissue engineering, and metabolic studies

### Phase III — LoomSense v3 (full vision)

The complete multi-dimensional biophotonic biosensor described in this summary.

- 400–1300 nm spectral capture
- sub-nm tunable resolution
- 100 parallel channels
- single-photon sensitivity
- picosecond timing analysis
- coherence detection
- monolithic or hybrid PIC + SPAD architecture
- edge-AI compatible data pipeline

**This is the final research-grade instrument enabling unprecedented biological insights.**
