# Cosmic Loom Theory - Simulations Module
"""
Loomfield dynamics and biological coherence simulations.

This module contains numerical solvers and simulation frameworks for:
- Loomfield wave equation: ∇²L − (1/v²ₗ)(∂²L/∂t²) = κₗ·ρ_coh
- Coherence regime transitions (chaos ↔ viable ↔ rigidity)
- Biological substrate dynamics (bioelectric, biophoton, microtubule)
- Pathology and healing dynamics
