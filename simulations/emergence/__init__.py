# Coherence Regime Simulations
"""
Simulations of coherence regime transitions in CLT.

CLT defines three regimes based on Energy Resistance (éR = EP/f²):
- Chaos: Low éR → decoherence, fragmentation
- Viable Window: Optimal éR → biological coherence, consciousness
- Rigidity: High éR → frozen dynamics, inability to adapt

This module will implement:
- Regime boundary detection and crossing dynamics
- Pathology as boundary collapse (seizure, depression, etc.)
- Healing as re-coupling toward viable window
- Critical slowing down near transitions
- Hysteresis effects in coherence dynamics
