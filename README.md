# Cosmic Loom Theory (CLT)

A computational research repository for **Cosmic Loom Theory** - a field-based framework proposing that consciousness emerges from coherent system dynamics operating within constrained energetic regimes.

## Overview

**Cosmic Loom Theory v1.1** focuses specifically on human biological consciousness, treating it not as a localized neural phenomenon but as a system-level property arising from integrated field dynamics. CLT introduces the **Loomfield** - an effective field description capturing how bioelectric activity, biophotons, cytoskeletal structure, and genetic constraints work together to maintain coherent organization in living systems.

### Core Principles

- **Energy Resistance (éR)**: Living systems operate in a "viable window" where éR = EP/f² balances between chaos (decoherence) and rigidity (inability to adapt)
- **Field-Based Integration**: Consciousness corresponds to coherent Loomfield states rather than isolated neural computations
- **Coherence Regimes**: Health and pathology are understood as expansion or collapse of coherent biological domains
- **Biological Substrates**: Bioelectric fields, biophotons, microtubules, and DNA as complementary mechanisms supporting integration

### The Loomfield Framework

The Loomfield (L) is not a new fundamental force but an effective description of coherence-relevant structure in biological systems. It captures:
- Spatial integration across distributed tissues
- Temporal stability despite metabolic turnover  
- Resistance to decoherence within viable energetic bounds
- System-level coordination that gives rise to unified conscious experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Scientific computing stack (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaKingRex/Cosmic-Loom-Theory.git
   cd Cosmic-Loom-Theory
```

2. Install dependencies:

## Current Tools

### Energy Resistance (éR) Visualizer
Interactive visualization of the viable energetic window where biological coherence can exist. Demonstrates how systems transition between chaos, viability, and rigidity regimes.

**Usage:**
```python
from visualizations.interactive import EnergyResistanceVisualizer

viz = EnergyResistanceVisualizer()
viz.render(interactive=True, show_trajectories=True)
```

See `notebooks/01_energy_resistance_intro.ipynb` for a detailed walkthrough.

## The LoomSense Connection

This computational work directly supports the **LoomSense** platform - a coherence-oriented sensing architecture designed to monitor biological indicators relevant to Loomfield integration. Code developed here informs both theoretical predictions and experimental measurement strategies.

## Theoretical Foundation

CLT v1.1 is grounded in:
- Bioelectric field research (Levin lab and others)
- Biophoton studies (Murugan lab and others)
- Cytoskeletal quantum biology (Penrose-Hameroff extended)
- Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Energy landscape approaches to biological organization (Picard lab and others)

Unlike purely philosophical or quantum-mystical approaches, CLT maintains compatibility with established physics while proposing testable mechanisms for consciousness emergence.
