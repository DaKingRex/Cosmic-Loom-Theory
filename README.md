# Cosmic Loom Theory

A research repository for exploring the intersection of quantum physics, consciousness studies, and information theory through computational simulations and visualizations.

## Overview

**Cosmic Loom Theory** proposes that consciousness and physical reality are interwoven through fundamental information-theoretic structures—like threads on a cosmic loom. This framework explores:

- **Quantum-Consciousness Interfaces**: How quantum coherence and entanglement might relate to conscious experience
- **Information Geometry**: The geometric structures underlying both physical and mental phenomena
- **Emergent Complexity**: How higher-order awareness might emerge from simpler physical substrates
- **Field Dynamics**: Modeling consciousness-related fields and their interactions with matter
