# Cosmic Loom Theory - Models Module
"""
Mathematical models for CLT biological substrates.

This module will contain implementations of:
- Bioelectric field models (ion channel networks, morphogenetic patterns)
- Biophoton emission models (mitochondrial coherence, oxidative stress)
- Microtubule coherence models (tubulin dipole dynamics)
- DNA constraint models (genetic topology, epigenetic modulation)
- Multi-substrate integration frameworks
