# CLT Coherence Metrics
"""
Coherence observables and metrics from CLT v1.1 Section 7.

Key metrics:
- Q: Spatial coherence (phase-locking, not just energy)
- C_bio = ∫ ρ_coh · Λ dV (consciousness observable)
- éR = EP/f² (Energy Resistance)
- Coherence density ρ_coh

These metrics quantify Loomfield organization and can be
mapped to LoomSense experimental measurements.
